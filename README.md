# Simpe BitTorent App 
A simple BitTorrent app is an application that implements the core principles of the BitTorrent protocol, allowing users to download and upload files via a decentralized peer-to-peer (P2P) network. The main idea behind BitTorrent is to break large files into smaller pieces and distribute those pieces among multiple peers, which helps speed up file sharing.
